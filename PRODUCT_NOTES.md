# Mixdash – Demo Logic Notes

This demo simulates the intended product behaviour.

## Session
- User starts a session manually
- AI listens during practice (fake for now)
- User marks moments as "felt right" or "felt off"
- Session ends manually

## Result logic
- PASS if positive feedback outweighs negative
- FAIL otherwise

## After session
- Feedback is shown
- Skills are updated (timing, transitions, taste)
- Next mission unlocks only on PASS

## Important
This is a UX + product logic prototype.
AI, audio analysis and persistence are not implemented yet.
